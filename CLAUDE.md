# CLAUDE.md — Rosetta's Portfolio (repo root)

> Top-level house brief for `webApps/portfolio/`. Read automatically at the

## What this repo is

Rosetta's personal portfolio — *Rosetta's Garden of Keys*. A root hub
(`index.html`) links out to a handful of themed **zones**, each a small,
self-contained, hand-made interactive piece (a toy, a game, a card). Same
containment-shelf spirit throughout: little loops for hands, eyes, and
attention — not "real" apps with menus, accounts, or win states. This repo
deploys to **GitHub Pages** (repo: `RosettasKeys/playground`).

## Zone map

Each zone has its own landing page with a distinct voice:

| Zone                | Nearest index                                | Vibe                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| root hub            | `index.html` (*Garden of Keys*)              | explorative, botanical, faint edge |
| `ecards/`           | `card-index.html` (*Deck of Cards*)          | whimsical, Wonderland              |
| `fidgetToy/`        | `fidgetToy-index.html` (*Fidget Toy Garden*) | calm, sensory, soothing            |
| `games/`            | `games-index.html` (*MISFIRE ARCADE*)        | unhinged, glitchy chaos            |
| `seasonal/`         | `seasonal-index.html` (*The Wandering Rose*) | seasonal, story-led, warm          |
| `milkyWay/`         | *(none — linked straight from the hub)*      | instrument, sourced, exact         |
| `semi-educational/` | *(none yet — linked straight from the hub)*  | instrument, plain-spoken, honest   |

Two zones have no landing page of their own and are linked directly from
the root hub: `milkyWay/` (The Long Field) and `semi-educational/`
(currently just Tornado Lab). Both are instruments rather than toys, and a
lobby for one room would be worse than no lobby. When a second piece lands
in `semi-educational/`, give it a `semi-educational-index.html` in the
established `<zone>-index.html` pattern and repoint the hub card at it. For
egg purposes both currently vibe with the root hub.

## Easter-egg protocol → read `AGENTS.md`

There is an `AGENTS.md` beside this file. **For any new piece or substantial
new feature, read `AGENTS.md` in this directory and follow its propose-first
easter-egg protocol** — thematically-matched egg, matched to the nearest
landing page's vibe, **proposed for approval before any of it is coded.** Skip
it for trivial work (fixes, copy tweaks, refactors). That file is the
authoritative source for the rules; don't restate them here.

## Shared constraints (repo-wide baseline)

The category baseline is spelled out in `games/CLAUDE.md` §5 and applies across
the whole portfolio unless a deeper file overrides it for its own subtree:

- **No API keys** of any kind in client-side code — this repo is public and
  forkable. Hard no, AI-provider keys most of all.
- **No build step.** Files open directly in a browser and deploy as-is to
  GitHub Pages. No `npm install`, no bundler.
- **No fail states** in toys/sandboxes unless a specific piece's own file says
  otherwise.
- **No paid/proprietary external resources** (fonts, CDN libraries, APIs) —
  free-to-use CDN resources are fine; flag paid options before adding.

## Case-sensitivity (deploy-time gotcha)

Local dev is Windows (case-insensitive); GitHub Pages is Linux
(case-sensitive). Links and paths must match on-disk casing **exactly** — a
`./FeedTheMountain/` link to a `feedTheMountain/` folder works locally and
404s live. Verify casing before committing web changes.

 * Structural checks over the records and the bibliography.
 *
 * These exist because the verification pass is the most valuable and the most
 * fragile thing in this project.  Sixty-odd records carry hand-checked
 * `sources` and `verified` blocks, and almost nothing about them is
 * expressible in the type system: a `supports` line can be emptied, a
 * `verified` block deleted, a citation key mistyped, and `tsc` stays perfectly
 * happy.  That work is expensive to produce and cheap to destroy, and this
 * repo is worked on by more than one agent.
 *
 * The function returns problems rather than throwing, so each caller decides:
 * the dev server throws on module load, the build fails at `buildStart`.
 * Deliberately nothing runs in the shipped page — a data slip must never break
 * the atlas for a reader, which would be a fail state, and this repo doesn't
 * do those.

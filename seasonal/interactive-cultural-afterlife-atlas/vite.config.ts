 * Fails the build if the records and the bibliography have come apart.
 *
 * The equivalent check in src/data/index.ts is gated on `import.meta.env.DEV`
 * and so vanishes from a production build — which meant, until this plugin
 * existed, that `npm run build` would happily emit a dist with citations
 * pointing at nothing.  The verification data is hand-made and hard to
 * reproduce; it should not be possible to ship a broken version of it quietly.
 *
 * Imports the data modules directly rather than through src/data/index.ts,
 * which touches `import.meta.env` and has no business being evaluated here.
